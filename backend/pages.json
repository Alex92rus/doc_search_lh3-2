The scheme definitely helped me secure my first job as a science writer as at interview they asked me about some of the pieces that I had written. The stories I had written proved that I had a good writing style and that I could follow a style guide and work to deadlines. As I had continued as a volunteer writer throughout my PhD, I also had a large number of articles in different areas showing that I could summarise complex ideas for a lay audience.\u00a0 The skills that I have learnt are still valuable several years in to my career as they have enabled me to quickly pick up new styles of writing, write news stories for lay audiences and know what makes a good press release. I am tremendously grateful for BioNews for giving me the opportunity to train with them.\nUCL Postgraduate Researcher, 2011\nI currently work for an advisory company and mentioned my experience with BioNews in my CV when applying. During my interview for this position, they pulled up one of the articles I had written while I was on the course and asked me to explain it to them and present the key findings. During this job we get asked by our members/clients about some of our older research, and they were testing my ability to speak confidently and coherently about something I had written a while before.

It is aimed at final-year postgraduate researchers preparing to edit their doctoral thesis.\nThe overall goal is to improve the clarity and impact of your finished writing. Prior to the workshop, you will be asked to submit examples of academic writing you admire, together with any specific points of syntax or grammar you wish to cover. You must bring to the workshop up to 1,000 words of your own writing on which to practise the techniques learned.\n\nThe course first sets out to define what participants mean by 'good writing' with a view to helping you gauge your own strengths and weaknesses as a writer. It explores the different layers of editing \u2014 from substantive or developmental editing (also known as 'deep' editing) to copy-editing and simple proof-reading \u2014 and sets out strategies for effective editing.\nThrough group and individual writing exercises, examples of good practice, peer review and tutor-led class discussion you will learn how to improve your paragraph and sentence construction; how to eliminate common faults in grammar, syntax and punctuation; and how to master techniques that aid clarity, vigour, concision and flow. The afternoon is devoted to a close reading of academic and selected non-academic texts that illustrate good writing practice, and the final hour to editing your own writing, using the techniques and insights you have gained.\nYou will come away with an edited version of your own writing to use as a template for further editing and recommendations for style guides, editing handbooks and online resources to help with your writing.\nThe workshop leader is Jennifer Potter.\nJennifer Potter is the author of four novels and five works of non-fiction, among them a biography, Strange Blooms, The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants, long-listed for the Duff Cooper Prize, and two widely admired and meticulously researched cultural histories.\nFirst appointed a Royal Literary Fund (RLF) Fellow at Queen Mary University of London in 2007, she established a new RLF fellowship for PhD researchers and postdoctoral fellows at King's College London, and has written and edited reports for public bodies and government departments, including the Treasury, the Information Commissioner, the National Archives and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\nShe reviews regularly for the Times Literary Supplement and is an accredited Royal Literary Fund Consultant Fellow: https://rlfconsultants.com/consultants/jennifer-potter/.\nPlease note that prior to the workshop, you will be asked to indicate any points of grammar, syntax or punctuation you would like the course to cover, and to submit writing by academic authors you admire. These will be circulated in advance to all participants. You will also be asked to bring to the workshop up to 1,000 words of your own writing in a format you can edit in class, whether hard copy or on a laptop.\nThis course is particularly relevant to the following groups:\n\u00a0"}, {"title": "Effective non-academic applications and CVs", "url": "https://courses.grad.ucl.ac.uk/course-details.pht?course_ID=2162", "summary": "Please note, courses are bookable for the current term only.

They will also demonstrate the transferable nature of the research skills you have acquired during your PhD, from an employer's perspective. In the process you will gain a better understanding of the UK labour market, and meet and network with potential employers and find out about career paths in a range of sectors.\nThis workshop will be delivered by Dr Sybil Wong, Head of Marketing and Communications at Sparrho.Sparrho is a startup combining human and artificial intelligence to disseminate scientific knowledge. Further information about Sparrho can be found here: https://www.sparrho.com/ \nThe ability to network productively is a key skill in academic and industry settings. This session will help you to understand what effective networking involves and will enable you to identify and make the most of networking situations. You will have the opportunity to practice some techniques within the workshop.\nLearning objectives:\n\u2022 Recognise the importance of networking when looking for work and in the workplace\u2022 Understand what networking involves and demonstrate your networking skills\u2022 Develop some techniques for connecting with new people\u2022 Develop some techniques for leveraging existing contacts\nDo you want the opportunity to understand more about how to demonstrate key employability skills such as teamwork, communication and organisational skills to an employer? Employers value these skills and they often use Assessment Centres in order to assess them. However, Assessment Centres are the point where candidates often slip up in the recruitment process. This workshop will give you the chance to try some exercises and help you to navigate the tricky points of demonstrating your skills in an assessed exercise.\nLearning Outcomes:\u2022 Deepen your understanding of the behaviours that employers typically look for throughout the recruitment process and, in particular, within assessment centres\u2022 Understand why assessment centres are used by employers in their recruitment processes\u2022 Develop familiarity with exercises and tests that may be used during an assessment centre to maximise your performance on the day, particularly regarding group assessment exercises\u2022 Gain the tools to evaluate your readiness for an assessment centre and those areas where you need to further develop your skills\nThis session will help you to develop general application and competency interview skills as required by graduate recruiters. It will focus on how to do well and common pitfalls to avoid. An informal and interactive format will be adopted involving plenty of opportunity for questions and further discussions.\nLearning Outcomes:\u2022 Confidently communicate your skills, experience and personal qualities in writing and verbally\u2022 Understand what employers are looking for throughout the recruitment process\u2022 Develop an awareness of the ideal structure and content of application forms/CVs and covering letters\u2022 Recognise and avoid common pitfalls in applications and interviews\nInterviews aren't meant to be easy! A recruiter will give hints and tips on techniques to give you the edge over the competition, as well as giving you the chance to try some practical examples. \u00a0\nLearning Outcomes:\n\u2022 Identify the differences between various types of interview\u2022 Understand why different interview methods are used by employers and what behaviours they are looking for in this part of the recruitment process\u2022 Answer typical interview questions with more confidence\u2022 Gain the tools to evaluate your performance at future interviews\u00a0\nThe transition from academia into the \u2018real world\u2019 can be a daunting one, with the requirements of the two areas seemingly very different. This is not helped by the attitude of many employers, who frequently do not fully appreciate the skills and experience research students can bring. This session will explore the differences between academic and non-academic employers.\nLearning objectives:\u2022 Appreciate the differing needs of academic and non-academic employers in order to:- identify and explain positively and convincingly why you want to move from academic research to a commercial role- pitch your skills and experience appropriately to an employer outside of academia\u2022 Understand the perceptions (and misperceptions) of non-academic employers\u2022 Develop and demonstrate techniques for effective negotiation\u2022 Identify the skills and experience that you have gained through your PhD and distinguish which qualities you may be able to offer employers which other graduates may not have\nCommercial awareness is about having a complete understanding of the career sector, company and job that you are applying for. It is the ability to view events and circumstances from a business perspective. This session is designed to help researchers understand the importance of commercial awareness when making the transition from their studies to the workplace. The session will focus on the methods through which research students can build their commercial awareness in the run up to job applications, and the benefits to be gained from this.\nLearning objectives:\n\u2022 Recognise why and how graduate employers look for commercial awareness in their recruitment processes\u2022 Develop techniques for increasing commercial awareness in order to apply for jobs and attend interviews\u2022 Communicate your commercial awareness more effectively to graduate recruiters\u2022 Gain the tools to evaluate your level of commercial awareness when applying for your next role\nThese sessions complement the Careers Consultant-Led Skills Workshops running throughout the year, and the Phd Employers Forums that take place in the Summer Term.\nNote: UCL Research students also have access to individual appointments with a specialist\u00a0Careers Consultant.

Knowing which aspects to include, and which details are not required by the majority of readers, is a valuable skill.\nStudies with clear results and findings can be easy to describe, particularly when the conclusions are consistent with those from other researchers, and there is biological or methodological plausibility. However, there are many occasions when findings are not easy to interpret, and must therefore be described very carefully. Learning how to do this is an essential skill, requiring good critical appraisal techniques; which will be a key feature of the workshop.\nThe workshop has the following learning objectives:\n\u2022 Know how to critically appraise a published article (essential when writing one\u2019s own paper)\u2022 Understand the basic structure of a journal article\u2022 Understand what to include and what to exclude, according to study design; and outlining strengths and limitations\u2022 Learn how to deal with and write up findings that are inconsistent with other work, or are unexpected\u2022 Know when to use \u2018firm\u2019 language (finding a balance between making an article appealing to a journal and maintaining scientific integrity and accuracy)\u2022 The value and structure of appendices\u2022 How to deal with reviewers\u2019 comments (including awkward ones)\nCourse recommendation\nThe workshop can be attended by doctoral students at any stage, particularly those who plan on developing journal articles during their degree. Many researchers are expected to publish their work, or be an author of other projects, and it is best to learn these skills early. The course is\u00a0aimed at researchers conducting observational or experimental studies (of people, animals or biological samples), which have a quantitative element. The examples used during the 2 days are all based on studies of humans, because they\u00a0need to be\u00a0understood by all students, so\u00a0there will be handouts on other types of studies (e.g. laboratory experiments).\nThis course will be led by  Professor Allan Hackshaw and Nicholas Counsell.\nAllan Hackshaw is an epidemiologist and medical statistician who has worked in a variety of disease areas over 23 years. Nicholas Counsell is an experienced medical statistician with >9 years\u2019 experience. Between them, they have written more than 150 journal articles and book chapters on observational studies, clinical trials, systematic reviews and some laboratory experiments. About a quarter are in high impact factor journals (New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Lancet Oncology, British Medical Journal, Journal Clinical Oncology, Journal of the National Cancer Institute and Brain), and the others in a variety of disease-specific journals. Allan Hackshaw also has 4 textbooks, and is a reviewer for several medical journals, so knows the common mistakes made by authors and also what they do well.\nThe course would be delivered over two days (with at least two days gap for preparatory work), using interactive seminars. The workshop aims to provide students with skills in writing papers, therefore students are required to read 2-3 published articles, sent before the workshop, which will form key sessions during the two days, so that they are familiar with the topics.\nExamples from the literature will be used, focussing on studies relevant to the faculties of Brain, Medical, and Population Health Sciences. But students from other disciplines are welcome to attend, as there are key concepts covered that apply to any research topic/study. Students are encouraged to share their own experiences, which the course tutors use to compliment examples from which they have worked (e.g. submission of papers and to examine reviewers\u2019 comments).\nExercises will include working in small groups. Examples would be to examine an article and write an Abstract.\n\nThis course is particularly relevant to the following groups:\n\u00a0"}, {"title": "Hugh Kearns workshops", "url": "https://courses.grad.ucl.ac.uk/course-details.pht?course_ID=2681", "summary": "Please note, courses are bookable for the current term only.

It will be possible to book onto courses running in the following term, from the last day of the current term during the academic year.\nEvidence is ubiquitous in modern society and culture. We expect rational people to hold the sorts of beliefs they do if those beliefs are supported by evidence. The efficacy claimed for some medical treatment or drug would be less convincing if it were only a matter of whim or opinion rather than evidential support. We expect jurors to consider evidence before delivering a verdict in a criminal court. And evidence is brought to bear on the most pressing concerns facing humanity today, from global warming to global terrorism.But what is evidence? In this unique interdisciplinary series of workshops, students will be introduced to the latest research skills and techniques employed to investigate evidence in a variety of disciplines. This will provide the student with an invigorating insight into the nature of evidence broadly, new research skills and a unique critical perspective on some of the most important questions engaging modern society.The aims and objectives of the course are:\nCourse tutor:\u00a0Jason Davies, CALT\nHistorians tend to have either too much evidence or not enough, and this makes it a requirement that they take a position of some kind on what is relevant and what questions can be plausibly answered. As we explore the implications of this, we are seeing different kinds of history emerge. But how do we make judgments about what kind of History we want? So, for instance, should reflections on the nature of History historicise? That creates a closed loop, of course, where History is the answer to everything. Nor can History be understood in terms of it being a science, since it eschews many claims that would plausibly make it a science.\nThis session frames History as the demystification, rather than the `mere' documentation, of the past. It also tackles some issues of relativism (with a small 'r') that arise and closes with some discussion of why historians (inevitably) find some elements of the past (notably religion) troublesome, to understand why evidence can only be one reference point in historical discussions.\nCourse tutor:\u00a0Harriet Shannon: Physiotherapy\nWhy does physiotherapy have such a murky history? Why does it continue to struggle with its identity today? This interactive session will be based around two case studies to explore the ways in which physiotherapists attempt to justify their treatment choices. First, we will be guided by a medical model for evidence-based practice. This sees the Randomised Controlled Trial as the most rigorous methodology for \u2018proving\u2019 the effectiveness of a drug or device. Through practical application, the advantages and shortcomings of this model will be discussed. We will then explore alternatives whereby patient preference, the physiotherapist\u2019s clinical experience and logic/rational thinking are given varying levels of importance to gather some ideas about where the physiotherapy profession could progress in the future.\nCourse tutor:\u00a0Jason Davies, CALT\nIn this workshop, we will consider (dis)integration and interdisciplinarity. Is an integrated concept of evidence possible or even desirable? What benefits and problems might it bring? What happens when evidence or methodologies normally belonging to one discipline is employed in another? Should integration be our aim, or is it enough to establish a common language to discuss a plurality of concepts of \"evidence\"? Perhaps most importantly, on what would we base our answers to those questions? In order to reach a deeper understanding of these issues, we will consider what it is to be a researcher within a \"discipline\" and the nature of \"(inter)disciplinarity\". This will offer an opportunity for reflexive thought about your own discipline, your research and methodologies, and the kind of understandings that emerge when you encounter other disciplines or material traditionally outside your own.\nCourse tutor:\u00a0Emma Byrne\nComputational modelling plays an important role in increasing our understanding of complex and poorly understood systems in domains such as systems biology, neuroscience and climate science. A system is its own most accurate model. However, evidence from the observation of complex systems is always incomplete. In contrast, computational models can be completely observed, but how can we know if the model is accurate?\nIn this session I will: explain the motivation for computational models; talk about how we can integrate evidence from real and simulated systems; and describe how computer science is applied across disciplines, in order to build ever more useful models. These points will be illustrated with examples from my recent projects, including the Robot Scientist (an artificially intelligent system that runs, and learns from, yeast genomic experiments) and CABot (a virtual agent that learns language through interactions with its environment.)\nCourse tutor:\u00a0Francisco Diego, Physics & Astronomy\nWhat is the Universe? Where does everything come from, including ourselves? We will explore the different ways to deal with these questions along human history, an evolutionary process driven by the inevitable accumulation of evidence. Starting with ancient beliefs and myths (soft evidence?) about the (supernatural) creation of everything the Universe, we will examine what modern science is finding (hard evidence?) about the formation of fundamental particles and forces that keep assembling the entire Universe. We will use a linear time line, where we will place selected major events in the history of the Universe along lengths of time well beyond our imagination. There are relevant issues (historical, philosophical, religious, ethical, scientific, etc) where soft and hard evidence enter in conflict. There will be time for discussion at the end.\nCourse tutor: Christian Hennig, Statistical Science\nWhen dealing with evidence, we deal with uncertainty. Probability models are an attempt to quantify strength of belief under uncertainty. Statistical methods such as p-values of hypothesis tests and Bayesian posterior probabilities can be used to quantify evidence based on data, and are used in many disciplines such as medicine, sociology, psychology, biology and law. In this session, basic concepts of hypothesis tests and Bayesian statistics are introduced and illustrated. While many scientists use \"pragmatically\" whatever approach seems to work in their situation, there is a still ongoing debate in statistics between frequentists (hypothesis tests are based on a frequentist interpretation of probability) and Bayesians. The underlying interpretations of probability will be confronted with each other in this session. Both camps have some quite good objections against the favourite methods of their \"opponents\". Some of these objections will be discussed and the persistent problems with the probabilistic quantification of evidence will be traced back to more essential problems of the relation between mathematical modelling and reality.\nCourse tutor:\u00a0David Lagnado, Psychology\nHow do people integrate a mixed and complex body of evidence? For example, when judging the guilt of a suspect, how do jurors assess and combine different items of evidence such as witness testimonies, alibis, confessions and forensic evidence? Do they conform to appropriate logical principles, or are they systematically biased? This workshop will introduce students to the main psychological theories of evidential reasoning: belief adjustment, the story model and coherence-based models. It will discuss the evidence for and against these models, and compare them to a normative Bayesian standard. It will also discuss some recent experimental studies that present problems for these theories. In particular, it will consider (i) what happens when evidence is discredited; (ii) the distinction between witness and alibi evidence; (iii) the effect of presenting evidence in different orders. On the basis of these findings, novel approaches to evidential reasoning will be discussed. The possibility of generalizing these beyond the domain of legal reasoning will also be considered.\nCourse tutor: William Twining, Laws\nThis is an interactive session where students have a chance to discuss examples of evidence in law. Case materials will be provided in advance.\nThe subject of evidence in law consists of two parts:(i) the general principles of practical commonsense reasoning applied in a peculiar context that is characterized by formal procedures and sharply focused issues;(ii) the Law of Evidence, which consists of (a) exclusionary rules, which set a series of disparate exceptions to the principle that all relevant evidence may be admitted; (b) decision rules and guidelines in situations of uncertainty when a final decision is mandated (e.g. standards of proof, presumptions).This session will focus on both parts, illustrated by specific examples.\u00a0\nCourse tutor: Elisabete Cidre, Bartlett School of Planning\nWhy and what do Urban Planners need to know about design? We will explore the nature and value of design education for future planning professionals and the emergence of the urban design discipline as interdisciplinary practice.\nFrom space to place, to placemaking and placeshaping, urban designers work across different scales, and make use of different tools, skills and methods at different stages of the design process. Is there a one size fits all urban design framework?\nTwo examples from London will inform the discussions: Nine Elms on the South Bank, the biggest regeneration project in the UK (Planning, 2013, issue 1956). This is a 12-year venture that aims to revive 25 interconnected sites spread across 195 hectares of the Thames riverfront under the umbrella of the Vauxhall, Nine Elms and Battersea (VNEB) opportunity area planning framework (OAPF, as part of the Spatial Development Strategy for London, also known as The London Plan). We will also look at Aldgate, a neighbourhood in East London, undergoing considerable change as one of the few projects undertaken as part of the 100 Public Spaces programme, in London.\nThese workshops are open to research students from all disciplines and does not assume any specialist knowledge.

This course, run by specialists in the Department of Science and Technology Studies, is designed to help.\nUsing their wide-ranging interdisciplinary expertise, this course sets out to explore the links between the sciences (broadly construed) and the historical, philosophical, and sociological context and issues surrounding them. We envisage the course to be particularly suitable for graduates in both sciences and humanities keen to familiarise themselves with the broader context and questions underlying their research areas. You will be guided towards relevant themes and perspectives through a series of sessions run by each member of the STS Dept. in turn (each focusing on a particular aspect of the science and technology studies, and broadly falling into the five categories of history of science, philosophy of science, sociology of science, science communication and science policy).\nThe aims of this training course are:\nBy the end of the course, students should be able to:\nLecturer: Dr Chiara Ambrosio\nOutline of topic: In an age of interdisciplinary collaborations, the idea that art and science should be working side by side is often pitched as the ultimate form of \u2018cutting edge\u2019 research. But what does really art have to do with science? What makes these interdisciplinary interactions successful, and what criteria should we use to judge their success? In this session we explore the long history of the collaborations between artists and scientists, and evaluate some of the different and often conflictual forms these collaborations take. We try to use that history as a critical framework to think about the value we currently attribute to projects that cut across art and science, and reflect on the implications of the widespread assumption that any collaboration between art and science will inevitably lead to interdisciplinary (and inherently desirable) results.\nThis session will run in the UCL Art Museum.\nNote:  if you are involved in an interdisciplinary project involving a collaboration between artists and scientists you are very welcome to share any material you think may be appropriate from your own research with the rest of the group.\nRequired Reading:If you are interested in a historical overview, read Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison (1992), \u201cThe Image of Objectivity\u201d, Representations, vol. 40, pp. 81-128.If you are interested in more contemporary issues, read Born, G. and Barry, A.

Why has the impact of Islamic science been downplayed, overstressed or even ignored? This seminar discusses how Arabic scholars a thousand years ago revived the scientific traditions of the ancient world and, in the process, created new disciplines and new directions for inquiry into the natural world. We look at the important changes in medicine, astronomy, optics and other sciences that appeared in Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo and Toledo. We will also consider why certain parts of this tradition receive praise while others\u2014for example, alchemy or later Islamic contributions to science\u2014are overlooked.\nRequired reading: David C.

This session looks at examples drawn from a number of disciplines (astronomy, computing, biology, physics) to find out how and why the Cold War provided a distinctive and important context for the development of recent science. We will also look at the changing historiography (how history has been written) of Cold War science, and ask broader questions about the roles and responsibilities of science in warfare.\nRequired reading: David K. van Keuren, 'Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62', Social Studies of Science Vol. 31, No. 2, Science in the Cold War (Apr., 2001), pp. 207-229\nLecturer: Prof\u00a0Andrew Gregory\nOutline of topic:\u00a0Science and religion are commonly seen as antithetical, both in the modern world and throughout their history. Is this view correct for the modern world? Is it correct for all of history as well? How did this view come about? What are the recent developments in how we see the relation of science and religion? What of religions other than Christianity? What of different denominations within Christianity? We will look at various examples from current debates, from different historical periods and different religions.

Briefly, EBM is the: \"conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients\" [Sackett 1996]\nWhile it initially rose to prominence in clinical medicine during the 1990s, its subsequent influence has been extremely wide-spread. Many decisions in social policy, for example, are now made using methods that are closely based on EBM practices. This change in application raises questions regarding the implications of exporting this method into such a different context.\nThis session deals with the methodology and philosophy of evidence-based medicine (EBM) as found in medicine and elsewhere. To begin, we will investigate the manner in which EBM should work in medicine (Guyatt et al 1992). We'll then move on to discuss some potential difficulties of this account, as reviewed in Clarke et al 2013. We'll conclude the session (and the course) with a brief overview of some of the challenges faced by those using EBM-inspired methods in medicine, and elsewhere.\nReading:Clarke, B., Gillies, D., Illari, P., Russo, F. and Williamson, J. 2013.

How do scientists make sense of uncertainty and communicate the risks?

It has long been thought that science and entertainment where diametrically opposed. However, in the last decade or so, scholars adopting an interdisciplinary approach to entertainment media, blending insights from science studies with media studies, have started uncovering links between science and entertainment that were previously overlooked.\nThis session is complementary with Carole Reeve\u2019s session on science in public.

However, whilst many public images of, and attitudes towards, science are very positive, an increasing number are negative, and it takes only a few high profile controversies (think \u2018fracking\u2019, cloning, GM, BSE, MMR, WMD) to generate the \u2018wrecker ball\u2019 effect. The results of scientific endeavour will inevitably be played out in society and this places responsibilities on scientists \u2013 to explain, question and defend their work \u2013 and on the public \u2013 to negotiate the most appropriate information in order to participate in the social processes of scientific debate, and in some cases, decision making.\nRequired Reading:Jane Gregory and Steve Miller, Science in Public: Communication, Culture and Credibility (Basic Books 1998)Mark Erickson, Science, Culture and Society: Understanding Science in the 21st Century (Polity Press 2005)\nOthersMaking Science Public, University of Nottingham blog: http://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/makingsciencepublic/Ben Goldacre, Bad Science (Harper Perennial 2009).

It deals in supposedly universal knowledge. Scientists have historically travelled and collaborated across the world in search of the best ideas, the best equipment and the most interesting projects. Scientists are interested in global problems, and may be involved in international governance mechanisms such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But for all the talk of universalism and a \u2018Flat World\u2019, what is the reality of global science and global governance? Politics, governance and ethics across the world are farfrom flat. They look very spikey indeed. In this session, we will explore the implications of globalisation for scientists and other individuals, especially those at \u2018London\u2019s global university\u2019.\nRequired reading: Caroline Wagner's The New Invisible College: Science for Development (Brookings Institution Press), free chapter available online\nOthers:The global governance of science, Report of the Expert Group on Global Governance of Science to the Science, Economy and Society Directorate, Directorate-General for Research, European Commission (available online)J Wilsdon and C Leadbeater, The Atlas of Ideas, How Asian innovation can benefit us all Demos, 2007 (available online)Thomas Friedman, The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005\nLecturer: Dr Phyllis Illari\nOutline of Topic: Humanity is currently engaged in a process of thoroughly altering its environment, through the development of science and the many technologies science generates, particularly information and communication technologies. Such rapid change often requires us to re-think existing conceptual schemes for the new environment. For example, what is theft, in a digital age?\nInformation ethics re-examines traditional ethics from the point of view of the philosophies of science and of technology. It offers a proactive approach, an ethics that goes beyond the reaction of an agent to a situation, to the collective actions of agents in creating ethical situations in the first place.\nWe will apply information ethics to issues of current concern, such as information warfare, and privacy and digital archives.\nRequired reading: Chapter 4, \u2018Ethics\u2019, in Philosophy of information: An introduction. available here\u00a0Contact\u00a0phyllis.illari@ucl.ac.uk\nOthers: Chapter 5, \u2018Society\u2019, in Philosophy of information: An introduction; Floridi, L.

The Evening Course Programme is designed to teach participants how to communicate effectively in a foreign language. All four skills are taught \u2013 reading, writing, listening and speaking \u2013 with a particular emphasis on oral communication. Courses cover the language as it is spoken today in everyday situations, from basic survival skills at elementary level through to fluent communication at advanced levels. Small class sizes allow maximum involvement of all participants.\nAcademic Reading Courses in French, German and Italian are offered from beginners to advanced levels and are especially designed to assist research students with the acquisition of reading from the very beginning of their graduate studies. These courses have been taught successfully over the last 10 years.\nAll courses are taught by language tutors with experience in the methodology of reading skills. Students are introduced to a number of core concepts of the language and specific aspects of reading at the respective levels, as well as selecting text material relevant to their own research for analysis. In the term 3 workshops particular attention is paid to participants' individual needs.\nParticipants who complete a course are able to assess, read and translate original academic texts at the respective levels, as well as scan research material in order to assess its suitability.\nLanguages offered include:\nLanguages offered include:\nThis one term course for learners of English, run by the UCL Centre for Languages & International Education, identifies students' pronunciation difficulties and provides assistance with English pronunciation.\nThese evening courses are offered in addition to bespoke DSDP training, which can be booked (free of charge) here.\nThis course is designed for graduate research students whose first language is not English, who are expected to speak at public lectures, seminars and conferences. The aim of the course is also to assist students to acquire adequate presentation skills in order to enable them to function more effectively in higher education or in a professional environment.\nThe teaching consists of one weekly 2-hour session, over 9 weeks. In addition, every student is provided with one individual tutorial of 30 minutes which takes place during the course at a time arranged between the student and the tutor. Regular general feedback on pronunciation and presentations is provided in the class. At the end of the course, participants will be given an exclusive weblink to a recording of their final 10-minute presentation to help them review and re-analyse their performance from any Internet-connected device.\nThese courses, run by the UCL Centre for Languages & International Education (CLIE), are specifically designed for graduate research students whose first language is not English and aim to equip students with the skills of academic writing in English. The two options/modules of the programme provide support at different points in a graduate\u2019s research.\nThesis Writing Option A aims to present and practise the organisation and rhetorical structures of the thesis together with the associated grammar. Participants should be registered for the MPhil/PhD and have yet to start the upgrading / transfer process from MPhil to PhD. Available in terms 1, 2, & 3, this course consists of 34 hours tuition. The course syllabus includes the following topics (subject to change):\nOption B aims to provide individual feedback on short extracts read and commented on for general structure and to suggest further work to consolidate and extend the student\u2019s academic writing. Writing cannot be proof-read. Participants should have successfully passed their upgrading / transfer and will preferably already have completed the Thesis Writing Option A course. Students are offered 5 hours of one-to-one tuition within a twelve-month period. Option B is offered throughout the year, with dates and times to be arranged between participant and allocated tutor.\u00a0\nFunding Note:\u00a0UCL Language Centres charge fees to attend these courses.

It will be possible to book onto courses running in the following term, from the last day of the current term during the academic year.\nThese workshops are open to students from all disciplines, but they are especially designed for those engaged in scientific research who would like to have an opportunity to reflect on the aims and methods of science more systematically than they can in the course of their usual work.\nPhilosophy of science addresses fundamental questions such as the following:\nThese questions raise serious challenges to our normal understanding of science and scientific practice. The main objective of this introductory course is to cultivate your ability to think through these issues in a clear, novel, and critical way.\nCourse tutor: Dr Brendan Clarke and Dr Chiara Ambrosio\nScience is often upheld as an ideal form of knowledge in modern Western and global cultures. Why do we think science is so valuable \u2014 and why do some people disagree? What exactly does it mean to be \"scientific\" anyway? We will explore these questions through a critical examination of the views expressed by some leading philosophers of science. Popper saw the essence of science as the critical spirit that challenges orthodoxy; in direct opposition, Kuhn argued that what enables \"normal science\" to function was the community's adherence to a paradigm, reinforced by a rather dogmatic style of education and training. Feyerabend sided with Popper in arguing that openness was beneficial for science, but denied that science should be given any special authority over other systems of thought. This workshop will explore these philosophical positions on science, and discuss issues arising from their opposition to each other. We will also discuss the practical implications of how we \"demarcate\" science from non-science: for example, on the assessment of grant applications and publications, and on our attitude towards various controversial systems of thought ranging from homeopathy to intelligent design.\nCourse tutor: Dr Chiara Ambrosio\nThis workshop will address one of the most fundamental questions about science: are we justified in considering our scientific theories \u201ctrue\u201d or at least \u201capproximately true\u201d? What are the dangers, and what would be the alternatives? We will explore the long legacy of realism in philosophy of science and connect it to the various attitudes that scientists have displayed toward the theoretical and empirical aspects of scientific research. The topic of scientific realism will allow us to venture into two foundational areas of philosophy: metaphysics and epistemology. Rather than abstractly speculating about these foundational issues, we will invite you to think about how particular metaphysical and epistemological attitudes and commitments might be implicitly built into your practice as a researcher, and discuss the conceptual and practical implications of adopting a realist or an anti-realist position in science.\nCourse tutor:  Dr Phyllis Illari\nThis workshop will explore the ethical challenges arising from scientific research. Some challenges will focus on the results of research and the ways in which it is disseminated. Others will concern the process of research itself, and science and society\u2019s effort at self-regulation. We will focus on specific case studies, which will be discussed in detail and connected to various conceptual approaches to ethics. The workshop will also allow you to share problems encountered in your own research as well as examples of good practice, and will provide you with useful conceptual tools to explore ethical issues systematically in the future. By the end of the workshop you will be able to express and defend ethical views and apply them to your own practice as a researcher.\nCourse tutor: Dr Brendan Clarke\nThis session will cover the topic of classification in science with particular reference to data. Data are the mobile pieces of information, which are collected, stored and disseminated in order to be used as evidence for claims about specific processes or entities (i.e. the phenomena) How can data be properly classified? We will look at the problems faced by scientists in classifying data in large datasets, problems with both the quantity and quality of data. We will also look at the use of incompatible classificatory systems for different purposes and discuss the philosophical implications of these pragmatic problems in scientific practice.\nCourse tutor: Dr Phyllis Illari and Dr Chiara Ambrosio\nUnderdetermination is amongst philosophers\u2019 (and scientists\u2019!) most loved and feared concepts. The idea itself was developed by the physicist and philosopher Pierre Duhem at the beginning of the twentieth century and was expanded by the philosopher V.V.O Quine in the 1950s. In this workshop we will revisit Quine\u2019s foundational paper \u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d (1951), a classic in philosophy of science, which is still much debated today. Both Duhem and Quine addressed a foundational issue in science: the realisation that the scientific evidence available a particular time is insufficient, in itself, to determine our belief or commitment to a particular theory. Philosophers now refer to underdetermination in pointing out that scientific claims and predictions are never tested in isolation, and in reaching broader conclusions about the limitations of evidence in our acceptance of scientific theories. This session will explore these themes in detail. Is underdetermination a threat to scientific objectivity and scientific progress? What role and credibility is left to experimental testing, if we adopt a strong version of underdetermination? How does this affect your practice as a researcher?\nWe strongly recommend attending all five workshops, which are specifically planned as a series.

By the way, Python is free, as in \"free beer\", and as in \"free speech\" too.\nThis six-hour crash course aims to introduce the basics of Python programming, explain its advantages compared with other popular programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Perl, and Matlab), and illustrate its usage in a number of different domains. The course will be taught in a practical hands-on lab setting. No prior knowledge of computer programming is assumed, but you need to be computer literate in order to follow the demonstrations and participate in the practical sessions.\nOutline topics to be covered:\nPlease refer to the following webpage for more information.\nhttp://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~dell/teaching/py_skills/\nThis course is particularly relevant to the following groups:\n\u00a0"}, {"title": "Research Integrity Workshops", "url": "https://courses.grad.ucl.ac.uk/course-details.pht?course_ID=2797", "summary": "Please note, courses are bookable for the current term only.

Disputes over consent, authorship, peer-review, collaborative research and misconduct have raised questions over researchers\u2019 understanding of integrity. As a result, UCL seeks to promote understanding of research integrity among researchers through a series of workshops that will be addressing various case studies and bring together specialists from different disciplines to discuss them.\nIn the first of this series of workshops, we will use an object-based approach to investigate a range of questions falling under the umbrella of \"research integrity\". Drawing on UCL's own medical collections, the session will question the relation of consent and the body. What kind of questions arise from the display of human remains?\u00a0Is\u00a0consent for \"historical\" remains merely a superfluous requirement, considering what science can gain from their study in the present? What\u00a0does \"the public\" gain from the display of human remains in museums?\u00a0We will take a broad\u00a0interdisciplinary approach to these issues in the context of consent, drawing on history, philosophy and material culture.\nThe aim of the session will be to use tangible examples to get you thinking about similar\u00a0research integrity issues and questions that might arise from your own research projects, and offer a venue for exchange of good practice across disciplines.\u00a0\n\nThe session will be facilitated by a team of UCL experts:\n\nIn this workshop we will be taking some fascinating objects from the collection of the UCL Art Museum as a starting point for a panel discussion of issues around copyright. This will include the range of works which are protected by copyright, how long it lasts, who owns copyright and how ownership changes. We will also be looking at the legal and ethical constraints on reproducing the work of others in the context of academic research, the concept of managing copyright risk and the issues which arise in projects to digitise substantial art collections. Among the museum objects we shall be considering are engravings by Hogarth which also have a special significance in the history of copyright law in this country.\n\nThe session will be facilitated by a team of UCL experts:\n\nThis course is particularly relevant to the following groups:\n\u00a0"}, {"title": "Research Means and Ends", "url": "https://courses.grad.ucl.ac.uk/course-details.pht?course_ID=2985", "summary": "Please note, courses are bookable for the current term only.

Initially it can be full of excitement and learning, yet as you get further into the academic process it can become much harder to retain your enthusiasm and motivation in the face of looming deadlines, difficult results and increasing pressure to succeed. And currently there are ever increasing financial pressures on academics and academic institutions.\nAt the heart of our ability to do well in these \u2018do more with less\u2019 times is our own personal resilience; we have never needed to be more resilient than when we are faced with the prospect of not just surviving but of thriving in our jobs and careers. Resilience can be defined as the ability to spring back after being bent, stretched or compressed, and for people it is often described as the ability to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions. That is of course easy to say, but significantly harder to translate into robust, consistent and sustained resilient behaviours.\nIn this session we will explore the concept of resilience; the set of skills and attributes that allow people to do really well in the situations that can sometimes cause others to flounder. We will look at the 10 key characteristics of resilience, and some of the techniques that you can use to increase your own resilience in the context of taking control of your working day.\nWorking in academic environments we are all academic high achievers \u2013 at least to the \u2018man and woman on the street\u2019.

From our hospitals to our shops, from our towns to our countryside, from our homes to our workplaces, research and innovation have changed our world and our lives, and will continue to do so. Many of these changes have positive impact on human welfare and wellbeing.\n\nBut science and technology, and the way that new products and practices are envisaged and generated, also create new risks and ethical dilemmas we have not faced before. Researchers and innovators do not always succeed in solving the problems they are meant to, and sometimes projects lead to unexpected results, create controversy, and reinforce inequality.\n\nOver the past few decades, various public engagement exercises have involved European citizens in discussions and policy decisions regarding science. Collaborations between scientists, ethicists and social scientists have been set up. Experiments have been carried out with open source research data, user-driven innovation, citizen science and much more besides.\n\nThese efforts have led to a European-wide approach in Horizon 2020\u00a0\u00a0called\u00a0\u00a0Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).

Divided into three equal parts, the workshop first explores and examines the voice itself from intention to comprehension, and gives participants the chance to form an objective opinion about their voice; something we all too frequently shy away from.\nThe second part is a purely practical vocal warm up drawn from many years of theatrical practise. Participants should be under no illusion that this course, if it is to be useful, cannot remain purely theoretical. It includes elements like physical relaxation, breathing, a detailed exploration of the simple hum, the identification of body parts responsible for vocal projection and a celebration of what voices can do. All of these are undertaken in a whole group setting with no one being required to work individually.\nThe final section aims to equip participants with a tool with which they can develop vocal control and tonal nuance. Based on the work of the late Yat Malmgren, Movement Psychology for Voice is a toolbox for performers that harnesses the connection between an inner sensation and an outer manifestation, and can be used by anyone prepared to really roll their sleeves up and get stuck in.\nOf all the body\u2019s tools for expression, the voice is the one that works perfectly at birth and slowly becomes hampered by habits, toxins and often our own thoughts. Specific Heat Capacity aims to equip participants with a framework and methodology that helps them set out on a journey back towards the time when their voice worked tirelessly, effortless and freely.\n\nThis course will be led by Piero Vitelli.\nBefore 1995, Piero worked in retail as a West Indies based yachtsman, a butcher, a professional sound engineer and an actor with three years professional training in the Stanislavski method.

We were offered a limited number of places on the theoretical sessions.\nStatistical Parametric Mapping refers to the construction and assessment of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in a software package called SPM, which is one of the most popular tools for the analysis of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI and fMRI), and magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG and EEG) data. The software is developed by members and colleagues of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, and these courses are hosted by the UCL Institute of Neurology.\nThe courses cover: the analysis of MRI And fMRI, separated into two courses, one for those with previous experience of the SPM software, and one for beginners, which also covers positron emission tomography (PET) data; the physics underlying MRI and fMRI; and the analysis of MEG and EEG data.\nThe courses will combine theoretical presentations with practical demonstrations of the different data analysis methods implemented in SPM.\nCourse director:\u00a0\u00a0Dr Guillaume Flandin and\u00a0Dr Peter Zeidman\nCourse programme:\u00a0 http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/course/london/programme.html\nCourse details:\u00a0The course covers the analysis of neuroimaging data from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and structural MRI. The three days of the course will be divided into theoretical sessions covering experimental design and statistical inference and practical sessions in which SPM will be used to analyse exemplar data sets. This course is suitable for beginners and more advanced users, with topics ranging from image pre-processing to analysis using the General Linear Model (GLM), Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and connectivity analysis using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). We advise attendees to gain at least some minimal familiarity with the methodology, for example, from reading introductory articles available from the SPM website (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/intro/).\nCourse director: Dr\u00a0Nikolaus Weiskopf and Dr Samira Kazan\nCourse programme:\u00a0http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/course/london/\nCourse details: The course introduces the basics and some advanced topics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used for human neuroimaging.

All analyses should be now done with statistical packages, without the need to understand in detail how the methods work. Our goal is to concentrate on knowing when to use the most appropriate statistical method for each analysis, but importantly, properly understanding the output. Terms such as confidence intervals and p-values are presented using simple language.\nAll the sessions use examples from the literature, based on a variety of topics from the different faculties (including human and laboratory studies), and are interactive.\nThe course is run over 4.5 days (two weeks). Exercises are provided at the end of each day, and are discussed by the tutors in the following session.

Would you like to engage as well as to inform? Do you want to develop your effectiveness and impact as a writer? \nThese two linked half-day workshops are designed for researchers embarking on a doctoral thesis. They will be especially useful for students in Arts & Humanities, the Built Environment, Laws, Social and Historical Sciences, and for students in other disciplines wishing to communicate their research to non-specialist audiences. Led by an experienced writer and editor, they will help you develop your capabilities and skills as a writer, enabling you to find the story in your thesis and to write with clarity, vigour and impact.\nParticipants must sign up for the two workshops. Taken together, they will establish the ground rules for good writing and help you develop your own individual voice and style.\nWorkshop 1: Storytelling for academic writers\u00a0explores how to structure a compelling narrative using techniques and strategies adapted from the art of storytelling. Through group and individual writing exercises, examples of good practice, peer and tutor review and much focused discussion you will learn how to define your audience and purpose; how to engage your reader with strong openings, research questions, hooks and signposts; and how to find the story in your thesis.\nWorkshop 2: Developing your craft skills in writing is scheduled for several days later. Using similar methods, it focuses on the craft aspects of writing: how to develop a persuasive argument; how to write with clarity, vigour and precision; how to construct sentences and paragraphs that aid flow and modulate your argument; how to avoid the common pitfalls of bad grammar and punctuation; and how to edit effectively.\nThe workshop leader is Jennifer Potter.\nJennifer Potter is the author of four novels and five works of non-fiction, among them a biography, Strange Blooms, The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants, long-listed for the Duff Cooper Prize, and two widely admired and meticulously researched cultural histories.\nFirst appointed a Royal Literary Fund (RLF) Fellow at Queen Mary University of London in 2007, she established a new RLF fellowship for PhD researchers and postdoctoral fellows at King's College London, and has written and edited reports for public bodies and government departments, including the Treasury, the Information Commissioner, the National Archives and\u00a0the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\nShe reviews regularly for the Times Literary Supplement and is an accredited Royal Literary Fund Consultant Fellow: https://rlfconsultants.com/consultants/jennifer-potter/\nThe course is not intended for students seeking help with second language issues\nPlease note that participants are required to attend both workshops.

This session takes one step back and shows students how to judge what is worth their time and attention in the first place, how to strategise their literature search in a scholarly way, then leads them to attainable improvements in personal reading rates and retention by understanding cognitive processes and adopting good reading practices.\u00a0\nLiterature Review (afternoon session)\nLeading naturally from the morning session, this module explains the right way to tackle a literature review - frequently the earliest task in the research process. The scope and objectives of a literature review will be made clear, and the strengths and weaknesses of the various types of material will be discussed. Effective note taking and record management, avoiding plagiarism, and structuring the review appropriately will be covered.\nThis workshop is the 1st part of 3-day Your PhD programme specifically designed for first year research students and taught by external consultant Dr Louise Baron.
